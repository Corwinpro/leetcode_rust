# Learning Rust by solving Leet Code problems

Rust is great.

I am learning the basic bits of Rust (from the standard library) by solving common Leet Code problems.

An intermediate goal is to get Rank 100'000 on Leet Code which is ~300 solved problems.

Current rank: 679'000 with 103 problems solved.
